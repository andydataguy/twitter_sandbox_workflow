# ORIGINAL High-level Overview

> Engineer's notes: Our overarching goal with this application is to develop a Twitter profile that not only matches but surpasses existing profiles that report on significant on-chain activities, such as substantial token purchases or transfers and other tokenomic irregularities. Currently, many of these profiles rely on basic Python scripts to extract and broadcast this data without adding any substantive context or analysis. We aim to differentiate ourselves by leveraging the comprehensive capabilities of LangGraph to simulate an entire research team. This virtual team will create in-depth reports, provide critical insights, and collaborate effectively to produce high-quality content. The objective is to offer a level of detail and expertise akin to that of a crypto analyst, thereby creating a profile of unparalleled value compared to existing whale-watching accounts. Our approach is designed to be both innovative and difficult to replicate, as the volume and depth of information generated would typically require substantial human effort, which we automate to handle the fast-paced nature of these market movements. By understanding not just our technical goals but also the strategic reasons behind them, we can focus on maximizing value creation. This involves optimizing everything from prompt design and data modeling to business logic and beyond. While our current scope is limited to tracking a single token, our system's modular architecture is intentionally designed to adapt and expand in response to market opportunities and evolving needs, ultimately functioning as a sophisticated Twitter publishing entity that efficiently manages and interprets data from the Mega Whale Trades Twitter account.
