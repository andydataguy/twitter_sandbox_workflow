> Engineer's notes: The state directory is a critical component for optimizing performance in multi-agent systems using LangGraph. It's not sufficient to merely connect language models and expect optimal functionality. These systems generate various artifacts and components at both the node and subgraph levels that need careful management. Additionally, there may be external data that must be incorporated and maintained within the runtime environment. To fully leverage the capabilities of LangGraph systems, it's essential to adopt both tactical and strategic approaches in managing the state. This involves thoughtful consideration of how state data is organized and utilized to enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the system.
